# codetell Documentation

CodeTell is an AI-powered tool that automatically generates documentation for code. It allows code to tell its own story by providing explanations and descriptions of the code's functionality. The project includes a README file with instructions on how to use the tool, as well as a source code file named `__init__.py` in the `codetell` directory.

## `codetell/__init__.py`

The code is a Python script that is used to generate documentation for source code files in a given directory. It uses the OpenAI API to generate summaries, descriptions, and other documentation based on the source code.

The script includes several classes and functions:

- `Page`: A data class representing a page of documentation, with attributes for text, total tokens, source, and error.
- `MODEL_SHORT` and `MODEL_LONG`: Constants representing different models for generating documentation.
- `INCLUDES` and `EXCLUDES`: Lists of file patterns to include and exclude when searching for source code files.
- `Cache`: A type hint representing a dictionary of `Page` objects or `None`.
- `PROMPTS`: A dictionary of prompts for different types of documentation.
- `find_files`: A function that searches for source code files in a directory based on the given patterns.
- `get_lang`: A function that determines the language to use for documentation generation.
- `make_summary`: A function that generates a summary of the project based on the README.md file and the list of source code files.
- `make_description`: A function that asks the OpenAI API to generate documentation for a specific file based on a given prompt.
- `make_page`: A function that creates a page of documentation for a file.
- `CodeTell`: A class that represents the documentation generation process, with methods for generating summaries, writing documentation, and more.
- `main`: The main function that is executed when the script is run, which parses command line arguments and initiates the documentation generation process.

To use the script, you would typically run it from the command line, providing the directory name as an argument. The script will then search for source code files in that directory, generate documentation for each file, and write the documentation to an output file. The generated documentation can include summaries, descriptions, code reviews, and API reference manuals, depending on the prompts and options provided.
