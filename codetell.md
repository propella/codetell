# codetell project

CodeTell is an AI-powered tool that automatically generates documentation for your code. By using natural language processing, it allows your code to tell its own story. The project includes an `__init__.py` file in the `codetell` directory. To use CodeTell, you need to clone the repository, set up the environment, and provide your OpenAI API key. Then, you can run CodeTell on your source directory to generate the documentation.

## `codetell/__init__.py`

The code in the file `codetell/__init__.py` is a Python script that generates documentation for source code files. It uses AI-powered natural language processing to analyze the code and generate descriptions, summaries, and other documentation elements.

The code defines a class called `CodeTell` that represents the documentation generator. It has methods for finding source code files, generating summaries, creating pages for each file, and writing the documentation to a file.

The `CodeTell` class uses the OpenAI API to interact with the AI model. It sends prompts to the model and receives responses containing the generated documentation.

The script can be run from the command line using the `codetell` command. It accepts arguments such as the directory name of the source code, the language for the documentation, and options for dry run and summary generation.

Overall, this code enables developers to automatically generate documentation for their source code projects using AI technology.
